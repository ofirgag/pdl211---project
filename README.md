# pdl211-project
Simple neural network implementation

# Instructions
Run the file nn.py with data sets folder and nn_utils.py file in same repository.
The main method execute SGD algorithm with next params:

train_x - Training examples without their labels
train_y - Training examples labels
layers_dims = A list which represents the architecture of the network. Each element i in the list stend for the amount of units/neurons in the i'th layer.
learning_rate
mini_batch_size
epochs

Feel free to play around with different data sets and differen hyper parameters.
